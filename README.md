# Weratedogs Twitter Archive Data Analysis  
I worked on data from four tables gathered from 3 different sources including Twitter API to perform data analysis on the twitter page “WeRateDogs”. Data was very dirty and messy, so I had to clean it before starting EDA.
The data for this project is contained in the following files:  
twitter-archive-enhanced.csv: the archived tweets.  
image-predictions.tsv: prediction results from a machine learning algorithm trained on a sample of the archived tweets.  
tweet_json.txt: the extra data obtained from Twitter.  
while cleaned data is contained in the file twitter-archive-master.csv
